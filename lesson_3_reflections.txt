Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

GitHub could overwrite changes you've made if you automatically pull from the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are a GitHub function that clones a repository on GitHub. A clone makes an exact copy of a repository, either locally or remotely (e.g. on GitHub). A branch is a parallel version of a project, but part of one repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You are able to work offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Probably using DropBox or email. The entire process would be a little easier for beginners, but there would be very littel automated version control. Instead, you would have to keep backups of files that have been updated. Labourious!
