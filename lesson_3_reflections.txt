Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

GitHub could overwrite changes you've made if you automatically pull from the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are a GitHub function that clones a repository on GitHub. A clone makes an exact copy of a repository, either locally or remotely (e.g. on GitHub). A branch is a parallel version of a project, but part of one repository.
