What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates the envirnoment in which you can save the commits of your project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a temporary holding directory for a future commit. It allows you to add multiple files to one commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Only add the files that pertain to the particular commit you are wanting to make.
